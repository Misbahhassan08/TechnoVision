'''This program is abouit calculation of area and circumference of circle .In this program i had taken radius as input
user then implemented formula for the calculation area and circumference respectively'''
r=int(input('Enter radius of circle ')) #Getting input
area=3.14*r*r #Area Calculation
circumferance=2*3.14*r #Circumferance calculation
print("Area of circle is :",area) #printing area
print("Circumferance of circle is :",circumferance)#printing circumferance

# Q5. To swaps two Variable values
''' These line of codes refer to swa[pping the values of three variables then printing them'''
